       "\"Everybody has seen 'Back To The Future,' right? Whether you LIKE that movie or not, you've seen an example of how to make a time-travel movie work. A torn-up poster for 'Back To The Future' shows up in this movie, representing, perhaps unintentionally, what the makers of 'Tangents' (aka 'Time Chasers') did to the time-travel formula. Then again, the movie claims to have been made in 1994, but it looks -- and sounds -- like it was produced at least ten years earlier, so maybe they achieved time-travel after all.<br /><br />Start with an intensely unappealing leading man. I mean, what woman doesn't love gangly, whiny, lantern-jawed, butt-chinned, mullet-men with Coke-bottle glasses? Oh, none of you? Prepare to tough it out, ladies, cuz that's what this movie gives you.<br /><br />Second, add a leading lady who -- while not entirely unattractive -- represents many '80s clich��s: big hair, too much makeup, two different plaids, shoulder pads, acid-washed mom-jeans, etc.<br /><br />Throw in a Michael Medved look-alike who wears pink blazers with white pants, a stunningly transparent villain who talks like Mortimer Snerd and has an office that looks like a circus-themed library, and evil henchmen who have nothing better to do than direct air traffic. That's our cast, folks. Enjoy!<br /><br />I could try to explain the plot, but it will take a lot less time for you to just track down a copy of this movie and watch it yourself. If YOU figure out the plot, please don't hesitate to share it with me.<br /><br />I would strongly advise watching this movie with the help of the folks at Mystery Science Theater 3000. I don't think it could stand on its own.<br /><br />The film, 'Tangents': 3 stars -- at least they tried.<br /><br />MST3K's 'Time Chasers' episode: 8 stars -- they actually succeeded.\""
