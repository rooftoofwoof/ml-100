# 100 Days Of ML

## Day 0 : July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Taking fast.ai Lesson 1. Uploaded man/woman images to be classified.
                       Am still stuck figuring out how to provide labels.

**Thoughts** : Sleepy. But the show must go on.

## Day 1 : Jul 8 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Trying to install fastai stuff directly on Google Colab instead of using Clouderizer.

**Thoughts** : Getting at it.

## Day 2 : Jul 9 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Still trying to install on Google Colab.

**Thoughts** : Frustrating...

## Day 3 : Jul 10 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Finally realized you just have to go through the installations every time you start up a Google Colab notebook. Reverting back to using Clouderizer...

**Thoughts** : Hopefully can get started tomorrow. Gotta think of a way to initialize Clouderizer data so that my 1 hour window before I sleep is not wasted.
