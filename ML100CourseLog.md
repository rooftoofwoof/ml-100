# 100 Days Of ML

## Day 0 : July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Taking fast.ai Lesson 1. Uploaded man/woman images to be classified.
Am still stuck figuring out how to provide labels.

**Thoughts** : Sleepy. But the show must go on.

## Day 1 : Jul 8 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Trying to install fastai stuff directly on Google Colab instead of using Clouderizer.

**Thoughts** : Getting at it.

## Day 2 : Jul 9 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Still trying to install on Google Colab.

**Thoughts** : Frustrating...

## Day 3 : Jul 10 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Finally realized you just have to go through the installations every time you start up a Google Colab notebook. Reverting back to using Clouderizer...

**Thoughts** : Hopefully can get started tomorrow. Gotta think of a way to initialize Clouderizer data so that my 1 hour window before I sleep is not wasted.

## Day 4 : Jul 11 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Skipped!

**Thoughts** : Oh noes!! There goes my initial momentum!!

## Day 5 : Jul 12 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Back to Clouderizer. Found out how to label the pictures.

**Thoughts** : Continuing tomorrow...

## Day 6 : July 13 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Labeled about 700 pictures each of men and women. Highest accuracy without changing anything in the code was 86%.

**Thoughts** : Clouderizer rocks! The labeled men and women data was stored on my Google Drive account. Also was surprised to see such a high accuracy on such low resolution photos, i.e. about 50 x 50 pixels thumbnails. That just blew my mind.

## Day 7 : July 14 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Forgot what I did. But I did do something...

**Thoughts** : Gotta be more disciplined!

## Day 8 : July 15 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Ran into problems with missing weights and undefined commands. Fixed them, kinda.

**Thoughts** : Gotta be more disciplined!!!!

## Day 9 : July 15 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Ran the resnext50 architecture thingy on a very low-res (about 50x50 pixels) set of woman/man images. The accuracy was 83.3%. Then realized due to syncing complications between Clouderizer and Google Drive, the valid and train folders had the full set of images and the test set had repeated images.

**Thoughts** : Gotta download the data, sort them nicely, store them locally, send them back up to the cloud, without syncing.

## Day 10 : July 16 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Watched fast.ai lesson 3, 60% of it.

**Thoughts** : Tomorrow's task: Clean up and sort the woman/man dataset nicely, and then get dog breeds code running with lesson 1 code.

## Day 11 : July 17 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I think I did something. I forgot.

**Thoughts** : Let's just say I did nothing.

## Day 12 : July 18 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Again nothing.

**Thoughts** : Going great!

## Day 13 : July 19 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Nothing.

**Thoughts** : Funny thing is I don't remember why I did nothing.

## Day 14 : July 20 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Hit some bugs with Clouderizer losing partial data. Redownloaded dataset.

**Thoughts** : Seems like things are slowing down.

## Day 15 : July 21 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Ran through most of the dog breeds lesson 1 code, hitting some errors at the end.

**Thoughts** : Gotta solve the errors tomorrow.

## Day 16 : September 5 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learned how to run the Jupyter notebooks on Colab without Clouderizer, then ran dog breeds code until almost the end. Was limited by Colab computing speed.

**Thoughts** : BABY I'M BACK!!!

## Day 17 : September 7 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Visited the university HPC center and learned how to utilize resources there to run fast.ai.

**Thoughts** : If things work out, then the new cluster with much better GPUs might be available for machine learning usage.

## Day 18 : September 8 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Ran fast.ai dog breed identification code on development box.

**Thoughts** : Seems like it's as simple as installing anaconda, pytorch and fast.ai. GTX 1050 is a little faster than Tesla K80 when running the code.

## Day 19 : September 9 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Connected to development box from home via Cloudapps. Started to replicate by hand lesson1 code. Using man woman dataset from the webz.

**Thoughts** : Gosh... it takes so looooooong to replicate by hand. Hope it's worth it.

## Day 20 : September 15 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Replicated without using copy and paste the whole friggin basic process for lesson 1. Dug into every line of code except for learn.fit and ConvLearner.pretrained. Will upload replica onto GitHub. Dataset used is already on GitHub. Humans vs Zombies!

**Thoughts** : My brain got fried somewhere trying to code up the plots for the most correct/incorrect predictions.

Fun fact: The model was 99% sure Donald Trump zombie was human. I 100% agree. He's most human when he's a zombie.

## Day 21 : September 16 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Replicated the rest of lesson1.ipynb.

**Thoughts** : Lesson 1 done!!!~

## Day 22 : October 2 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Starting to replicate lesson 4 notebook. 

**Thoughts** : Today begins my uninterrupted streak to finish this freaking challenge.

## Day 23 : October 3 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Still replicating lesson 4 notebook. Bumped into a bug concerning an unfound file/directory.

**Thoughts** : The biggest obstacles are always the simplest things...
